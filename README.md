Now using the magnificent eval/apply dance (as in page 13 of the
Lisp 1.5 Manual), *scheje* is a tiny scheme implementation on Top of
Clojure.

Now *scheje* properly implements *define-sytnax*, ellipsis is properly
expanded into relevant symbols, which can be respectively used in the
generated *syntax-rules* templates. In fact, even *let* is implemented in
terms of *define-syntax*.

the two defining forms, *define* and *define-syntax* generate new
environments as per the bindings they introduce. Helper functions that
interpret these along with other evaluations will be discussed later.

This implementation greatly improves the latest version, which used to
use Clojure macros. Using lists evaluation, it is possible to use
scheje as a library on top of ClojureScript as well.
## Usage

The main interpretation function is *form-eval* in the *interpreter*
name-space.


You give it a form and an environment, and you get your evaluation:
```clojure
(form-eval '(+ x y) '{x 1 y 2})
;;=> 3
```

But there is a more advanced function *eval-prog*, that evaluates a
whole program. This function is bootstrapped with a starting
environment (implementing some basic symbol definitions and the *let*
form defined with *define-syntax*). It also does what it takes to only
show the latest form evaluation in its input program.

Here are two samples:

```clojure
(eval-prog  '((define-syntax let
                (syntax-rules ()
                              ((let ((var expr) ...) body ...)
                               ((lambda (var ...) body ...) expr ...))))
              (let ((x 1)(y 2)) (+ x y))))
;;=>3
```
This example shows how we did to introduce the let form, though it is
already implemented in the root environment used by scheje, so you
don't have to define it every time you use *eval-prog*

```clojure
(eval-prog '((define append
               (lambda (l1 l2)
                  (cond
                    ((null? l1) l2)
                    (else (cons (car l1) (append (cdr l1) l2))))))
             (append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))))
;;=> '(1 2 3 4 5 6)
```
The above example is the must-have *append* function, necessary for
every decent scheme implementation!

Also, *quote*, *quasiquote*, *unquote* and *unquote-splicing* are
supported:

```clojure
(form-eval '(quasiquote
             (1
              (+ 1 (unquote-splicing (cdr '(1 2 3)))) 
              (unquote  (+ 1 a)))) 
           { 'a 5})
;;=> (1 (+ 1 2 3) 6)
```
